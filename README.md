# Mono Task - Your simple and modern To Do List

This Vite React app project is a simple, modern flat themed To Do List.
Users can add To Do tasks, mark/unmark them as completed and delete them.
The user can filter the tasks for _Completed_, _Open_ and _All_ tasks.

## Review
This was done in a span of 1 week and with little to no experience in React, Git and Typescript. It was both very fun and challenging.
Further Improvements and Features that crossed my mind:
- Toggle between Light/Dark Mode
- Mobile View
- Search Function to find tasks
- Add smoother transitions and animations for a better user experience
- Adding Images to tasks
- Login Feature to save data online and enable synchronisation
- and many more possibilites...
